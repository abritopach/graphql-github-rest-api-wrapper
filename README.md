# Graphql-Github-Rest-Api-Wrapper

    Sample project that shows how to wrapping a REST API with a GraphQL schema. Weâ€™ll go with the GitHub API.
    This project is simply an example of how to wrapping a REST API. GitHub has its own GraphQL API (https://developer.github.com/v4/) 
    which is what we should use in a project.

    This project has been developed to practice my skills with the tech stack:

    GraphQL over REST with Node, Express and Apollo Engine.

## Running

Before you go through this example, you should have at least a basic understanding of GraphQL concepts. You must also already have node installed on your machine.

* Test:

To run it, cd into `graphql-github-rest-api-wrapper` and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/graphiql and test query.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
